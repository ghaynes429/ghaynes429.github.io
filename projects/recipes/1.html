		<p>Hello! I am Gabe and I'm gonna teach you how to make a very good strawberry banana smoothie! (Serves 1 Person)</p>
		<p>This recipe is important to me as my little brother is a very picky eater, and we wanted to make a smoothie that was "close enough" to McDonalds and therefore he'd eat it.</p>
