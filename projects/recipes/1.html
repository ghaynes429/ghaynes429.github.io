		<p>Hello! I am Gabe and I'm gonna teach you how to make a very good strawberry banana smoothie! (Serves 1 Person)</p>
		<p>This recipe is important to me as my little brother is a very picky eater, and we wanted to make a smoothie that was "close enough" to McDonalds and therefore he'd eat it.</p>
		<q>It's not McDonalds, but... It's ALMOST there.</q>

		<h2>Step-by-Step</h2>
		<p>First things first, you'll need yourself a blender, a sturdy sandwich bag, and a rolling pin or something hard.

		<h3>How should you put the ingredients in?</h3>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Put all wet ingrdients first, start with the milk and add the yogurt in.</li>
			<li>Blend together for up to 10 seconds just to mix it all up.</li>
			<li>Add in the slice fruit in around 1/2 cup increments. Blend each time until left with minimal chunks</li>
			<li>Put some ice in a sandwich bag and beat it with something hard until it's in blendable chunks</li>
			<li>Blend until ice is there but not there if you get what I mean (Like you can chew the ice but not crunchy)</li>
			<li>Put in a cup, serve with a big straw.</li>
			<li>[OPTIONAL] Add a dash of strawberry syrup in the cup, mix in with straw or a spoon</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>When blending together the milk and yogurt, blend for 3-5 seconds instead of 10 for a thicker smoothie</li>
			<li>Freeze fruit beforehand if you want more of a fruit slushie texture</li>
			<li>Add more or less milk for consistency purposes</li>
		</ul>
