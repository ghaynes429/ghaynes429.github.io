			//it takes input but does not give output
			//instead, it goes and interacts with the world
			console.log("test");

			//let's write our own function
			function sayHi(){
				console.log("hi");
			}

			//ok, now call or ("execute") the function
			sayHi();
			sayHi();
			sayHi();
			sayHi();

			//function with inputs
